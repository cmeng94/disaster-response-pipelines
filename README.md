## 1. Project Description
The goal of this project is to analyze disaster message data and build a model that classifies disaster messages. The initial data sets contain pre-labeled messages that were sent during disaster events. This project uses NLP (natural language processing) and ML (machine learning) techniques to process and categorize disaster response messages.

Components of this project include
* an ETL pipeline that prepares and cleans data, 
* an ML pipeline that transforms data using NLP techniques and builds an ML classification model, and a Web App that displays data visualizations and classifies new disaster messages.
